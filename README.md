# Signature Verification Web App

## Overview

This web application verifies if two physical pen signatures belong to the same person using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow. The core functionality involves a Siamese neural network that processes both signature images, calculates the Euclidean distance between their latent vectors, and determines their similarity.

## Tech Stack

- **Flask:** Lightweight and flexible Python web framework used for building the backend.
- **TensorFlow:** Utilized for building and deploying the Siamese neural network model.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Frontend technologies used to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload:** The user uploads two signature images.
2. **Preprocessing:** The images are preprocessed to prepare them for model input.
3. **Siamese Network:** Both images are passed through a Siamese neural network.
4. **Euclidean Distance Calculation:** The latent vectors from the network are compared using Euclidean distance.
5. **Result:** The app displays whether the signatures match (same person) or not.
